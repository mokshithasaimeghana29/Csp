                <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we have explored the factors influencing people's preferences for government versus private hospitals. Our research highlights the following key insights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost Sensitivity</strong>: Many individuals, especially those in low-income communities, prefer government hospitals due to their affordability and subsidized services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Perception</strong>: Private hospitals are often chosen for their perceived higher quality of care, advanced facilities, and shorter wait times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Government hospitals play a crucial role in rural areas, where private healthcare options are limited. In urban settings, private hospitals dominate due to their widespread availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust and Specialization</strong>: Trust in government hospitals varies across regions, while private hospitals are favored for specialized treatments and personalized care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Implications</strong>: The findings emphasize the need for policy reforms to address gaps in affordability, accessibility, and quality of care, ensuring equitable healthcare for all.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    This project underscores the importance of understanding public preferences in shaping healthcare policies. By addressing cost barriers, improving trust in government institutions, and enhancing accessibility, we can create a healthcare system that better serves diverse communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope this initiative inspires further research and action toward building a more inclusive and effective healthcare ecosystem.
